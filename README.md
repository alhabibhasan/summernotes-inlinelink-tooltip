# summernotes-inlinelink-tooltip

This WIP plugin for summernotes can be used as a starting point if you are trying to build a plugin as well.

This one sort of works but in a very ugly way. What it does is allow you to use a inline toolbar when adding a link to some text. 

Discontinued development as I moved to other rich text editors.

Might be worth having a look at the CKEditor i have also forked.
